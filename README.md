## Description

Filedrop is a simple file collecting server.
It can be used to quickly spin up a website that allows everyone to anonymously upload files to your server.


## Use Cases
Filedrop provides a range of use cases, including:

- **Anonymous Uploading**: You can easily upload files to the server without revealing your identity. This feature makes it an excellent tool for sensitive information sharing.
- **Uploading Files to Your Own Server**: Filedrop can be used to upload files to your own server.
- **Saving Files on the Go**: Filedrop allows you to quickly save files on the go without the need to log in - no matter on what device you are.

## Configuration

Filedrop does not need any configuration.
If you want to add authentication, you can use a reverse proxy like [traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) or [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).
